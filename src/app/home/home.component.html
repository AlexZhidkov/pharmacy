            <h3>CREATE ORDERS FOR PATIENTS</h3>
            <p>
                Simple and Intuitive. Training is always one call away.. but you probably won't even need any.
            </p>
            <h3>SMS INTEGRATION</h3>
            <p>
                Quda automatically keeps patients informed of their order status through an integrated SMS solution*
                leaving
                pharmacy staff free to attend to the important things.
            </p>
            <h3>ACCOUNTABILITY</h3>
            <p>
                All staff have their login code recorded. This ensures complete traceability, with time stamp, for each
                stage of each order.
            </p>
            <h3>NO MORE PAPER LISTS</h3>
            <p>
                Every chemist has "those lists" of patient names waiting for stock of popular items.
                Replace those efficiently with Quda Waiting Lists
            </p>

            <h3>FROM PACK -> COLLECT</h3>
            <p>
                Webbit tracks all packs through:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Packing</li>
                <li>Checking</li>
                <li>Collecting</li>
                <li>Delivery</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>NO MORE BOTTLENECKS</h3>
            <p>
                Heaps to pack.. or check?
                Allocate your staff to the correct area with a live chart so you can stay on top of progress every day.
            </p>
            <h3>DELIVERIES</h3>
            <p>
                Patients can be toggled to be delivery patients.
                When packs are checked they are added to a delivery list which is available to print out.
            </p>
            <h3>NO MORE PAPER</h3>
            <p>Throw out your paper logbooks and trust a cloud system that runs on all computers.
                Staff on the front counter can access Webbit, find pack locations and assist patients with minimal fuss
                or
                confusion.
            </p>
            <h3>STAFF AUDIT</h3>
            <p>
                All status changes have a staff ID connected registered with them.
                Staff are given permission to Pack, Check or Collect depending upon their position in the pharmacy.
            </p>
            <h3>ANALYSE WORKLOAD</h3>
            <p>
                Analyse your workload by getting live reports on how many packs are within each status so you can
                organise
                labour more efficiently.
